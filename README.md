# Coiny Chat

## The Problem We are Tackling
There is no well-adopted chatting solution consistent with Bitcoin's decentralized nature that provides high privacy, end-to-end encryption, and allows for wallet-to-wallet chatting utilizing Stacks wallets.

## Our Proposed Solution
Connect seamlessly using your Stacks wallet, and chat with other Stacks wallet owners using our secure messaging platform. Create a unique profile to avoid impersonation and enjoy private, end-to-end encrypted conversations.

## Key Features
- Seamless Integration: Connect using your Stacks wallet with just a few clicks.
- Wallet-to-Wallet Messaging: Send and receive messages, ensuring privacy and security.
- On-chain Profile Publishing: Create a verifiable profile directly on the Stacks blockchain. This ensures authenticity, making it easier for others to identify and connect with you securely.

#### Note

This project is built on top of the dm3 protocol, which is a layer-0 blockchain-agnostic messaging protocol. A few features were developed prior to the Bitcoin Olympics. However, all the features related to Stacks and Bitcoin were developed after the hackathon started.

## Online Service
The website is available at [https://coinychat.com](https://coinychat.com). All basic 1-to-1 chatting functionality is working properly, and the on-chain profiles are saved on the Stacks testnet. Soon, we plan to run on the mainnet.

## Future Plans
- Integrate with BNS and save profiles on Gaia.
- Propose changes to make the dm3 protocol natively support Stacks.
- Stay tuned...
